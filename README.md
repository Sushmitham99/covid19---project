Covid COVID-19 dataset has been taken and visualized 
COVID-19 vaccine is a vital preventive step that could aid in the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccinations are now widely accessible in the United States, and the CDC advises that all individuals aged 12 and older be immunized against COVID-19. We sought answers on how COVID-19 vaccination affected individuals.


The data was cleaned using Excel and Python. Pandas library in python was mainly used for cleaning and Excel’s built-in function was used to remove duplicates. Our original primary dataset consists of information on COVID-19 vaccine data by County. We’ve preprocessed the data and used only the information that was needed for our visualizations and our hypothesis.
