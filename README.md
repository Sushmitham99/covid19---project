Covid COVID-19 dataset has been taken and visualized 
COVID-19 vaccine is a vital preventive step that could aid in the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccinations are now widely accessible in the United States, and the CDC advises that all individuals aged 12 and older be immunized against COVID-19. We sought answers on how COVID-19 vaccination affected individuals.

The data was cleaned using Excel and Python. Pandas library in python was mainly used for cleaning and Excel’s built-in function was used to remove duplicates. Our original primary dataset consists of information on COVID-19 vaccine data by County. We’ve preprocessed the data and used only the information that was needed for our visualizations and our hypothesis. 
For the booster vaccination doses records after July 2021 were imputed as 0 since the booster shots have started in the month of August,2021.The COVID 19 vaccine data by County dataset records have the count of the people who received booster doses and immunocompromised people who received additional doses.
Median value has been substituted wherever appropriate when the values were missing as this would not affect the distribution of the data.
